# Trajectory Tracking with a Mobile Robot Using Linearization: a Model Predictive Approach

A model predictive controller (MPC) is applied to a
simple wheeled robot exploiting linearization along a reference
trajectory. The usual MPC formulation is adapted to the linear
time-varying (LTV) problem and a stability analysis is performed,
leading to two different designs for the controller. An extended
Kalman filter (EKF) is developed for controlling the robot when
a constant measurements disturbance occurs. Finally, some simulations
are performed both in Matlab/Simulink and in Gazebo
simulation environment to test the efficiency of the developed
MPC.
